## Installation
Simply install to your project:
```
sampctl package install BrunoBM16/samp-attachments-fix
```
Include in your code:
```Pawn
#include <attachment-fix>
```

## Description
Attachments remain in the screen while using a sniper or (HS) rocket launcher. 

Unlike other fixes, this will hide the attachments only for the player aiming with those weapons, not for everybody.
